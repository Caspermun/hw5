"I looked at him. He was very fat now and bald, but hiw eyes twinkled gaily and his fleshy, red face bore an expressions of perfect good-humour. The clothes he wore, terribly shabby the were, had been made obviously by a Spanish tailor and his hat was the wide-brimmed sombrero of the Spaniard. He looked to me as though he knew a good bottle of wine when he saw it. He had a dissipated though entirely sympathetic, appearance. You might have hesitated to let him remove your appendix, but you could not have imagined a more delightful creature to drink a glass of wine with.
"Surely you were married?" I asked.
"Yes, My wife didn't like Spain, she went back to Camberwell, she was more at home there."
"Oh, I'm sorry for that."
His black eyes flashed a bacchanalian smile. He really had somewhat the look of a young Silenus.
"Life is full of compensations", he murmured. The words were hardly out of his mouth when a Spanish women, no longer in her first youth, but still boldly and voluptuously beautiful, appeared at the door. She spoke to him in Spanish, and i could not fail to perceive that she was the mistress of the house.
As he stood at the door to let me out he said to me: "You told me when last i saw you that if i came here i should earn just enough money to keep body and soul together, but that i should lead a wonderful life. Well, i want to tell you that you were right. Poor i have been and poor i shall always be, buy by heaven i"ve enjoyed myself. I wouldn't exchange the life i've had with that of any king in the world."
